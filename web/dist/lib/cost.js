// web/dist/lib/cost.js — reading a cost aggregate that is kept split by source.
//
// The hub holds three kinds of money and this file exists so the dashboard
// cannot add two of them:
//
//   notional  claude + codex — what the tokens WOULD have cost at API rates.
//             Nobody is billed it; the subscription is.
//   billed    gateway — metered per call, so the figure is the invoice.
//   subscription  what the plans cost per month. Real, and not in the cost
//             column at all — it arrives as summary.subscription_spend.
//
// Real spend is subscription + billed. There is deliberately no total() here:
// every aggregate arrives as `cost: [{source, kind, events, cost_usd,
// unpriced_events}]`, and the only folds offered are the two that mean
// something. A blended figure is always plausible, which is exactly why
// nothing may produce one by accident.
//
// Each entry is already shaped like the object fmtCost (lib/format.js) reads —
// cost_usd, unpriced_events, events — so a per-source cell is fmtCost(entry).
