// web/dist/lib/i18n.js — this page in two languages.
//
// One dictionary per locale, English as the fallback for every key a locale
// has not translated: a missing key renders the English sentence, never a raw
// `spend.title` in the middle of a card. That is the whole failure mode worth
// designing against — a half-translated page should read as English in places,
// not as a key dump.
//
// Three things are deliberately NOT translated:
//
//   - `price_basis`, and the rest of an event's stored details. That string is
//     written at INGEST time and records which rate actually priced the event.
//     It is an audit record, not a label: a historical event must keep the
//     basis it was priced under, and rewriting it per viewer would be editing
//     the ledger to match who is looking at it.
//   - identifiers: model ids, account uuids, endpoint names, source keys.
//     `gateway` is what the API calls it and what an operator greps for.
//   - the product name. TokenLedger is TokenLedger.
//
// Server prose (RealSpendNote and friends) IS translated, but not here: every
// request carries ?locale=, so those notes arrive already in the viewer's
// language. See internal/i18n on the Go side.
