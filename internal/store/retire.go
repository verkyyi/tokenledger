// Retiring an endpoint, and the one case where deleting it is safe.
//
// `enroll` mints an endpoint; until this file nothing took one back, so an
// endpoint enrolled by mistake stayed on the roster forever and the only route
// left was stopping the hub and editing SQLite by hand. That is the bug: a
// product whose only way to undo a create is to stop the service will
// eventually get someone to stop the service.
//
// Two verbs, deliberately not collapsed into one:
//
//   - RETIRE keeps the row and everything pointing at it. Safe on any
//     endpoint, and the only thing offered for one that has ever reported --
//     its spend is already in the ledger, and removing it would quietly change
//     what last month cost.
//   - DELETE removes the row, and refuses unless the endpoint never reported
//     anything at all. That is the mint-then-abandon case and nothing else.
//
// Deleting a used endpoint would not even be a clean removal: nothing in the
// schema references endpoints(endpoint_id), so SQLite's foreign keys cannot
// cascade or refuse -- the row would vanish and nine tables would keep rows
// pointing at an id that no longer names anything. EndpointFootprint counts
// those rows up front instead, and DeleteEndpoint refuses on any of them.

// endpointRefTables is every table keyed by endpoint_id, and therefore
// everything DeleteEndpoint has to find empty before it will remove the row.
//
// Listed explicitly rather than discovered from the schema at runtime: a new
// table that carries an endpoint_id must be a deliberate addition here, and
// failing to add it should be caught by review, not silently make deletion
// lossy. TestEndpointRefTables_CoversSchema keeps the list honest.
