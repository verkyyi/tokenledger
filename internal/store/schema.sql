-- on every read, from the rollups, and that is deliberate -- a findings table
-- would be a second copy of numbers that already exist and would go stale the
-- moment a rule or a threshold changed. What cannot be recomputed is the

-- finding, keyed by the stable id internal/findings/identity.go derives.

-- rule never fires. Forcing every silence to end makes it self-correcting --
-- the worst case is being told again about something already handled.
--
-- Rows outlive their expiry until something writes: reads filter on the clock
-- (store.ActiveFindingMutes) so an unpruned row can never silence anything,
