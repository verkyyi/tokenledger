// ResolveFingerprint maps a fingerprinted account key onto a real account uuid
// when the two are provably the same subscription.
//
// A fingerprint is a guess at identity made from a schedule. A machine that is
// logged in reports its account's uuid AND, through its sessions, that same
// account's reset schedule — so the guess and the fact describe one thing.
// Nothing joined them, and the result was a phantom standing next to the real
// account: on this hub, one subscription appeared three times, twice as
// win_… and once as itself, each with its own slice of the usage.
//
// The join is the seven-day reset phase, the same value the fingerprint is
// built from: if a known account's latest reading fingerprints to this key,
// they are the same subscription.
//
// It matches against EVERY account, including other fingerprints — not only
// accounts known by uuid. A subscription that has never been seen logged in
// exists on this hub only as a fingerprint, so restricting the match to real
// uuids leaves it unable to recognise itself: the georgetown subscription here
// had no uuid, and every change to the fingerprint's own definition minted it a
// fresh identity beside the old one. A real uuid still wins when one matches,
// and otherwise the earliest-seen account does, so repeated resolution
// converges rather than ping-ponging between two equal candidates.
//
// Returns key unchanged when nothing matches — an unmatched fingerprint is a
// subscription this hub has genuinely not seen before, which is exactly the
// case fingerprinting exists for.
