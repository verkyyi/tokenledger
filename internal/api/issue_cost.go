// #57 put an issue number on every spend row that could carry one. This is the
// read that #58 asked for: for one repository and one window, what the money
// landed on, what each issue has cost over its whole life, and -- always, never
// as an option -- how much of the window was never attributed to anything.
//
// Three rules from the issue, and each is enforced here rather than left to a
// renderer:
//
//   - The three kinds of money are never added. Every figure travels as a
//     store.CostBySource, which has no Total() to reach for.
//   - The unattributed bucket has a place on the chart. The response carries it
//     next to the attributed total and the grand total, so a reader can check
//     that the parts sum instead of trusting that they do.
//   - Thresholds come from the repository. `stale` is null, not false, when no
//     shipper has computed close-time percentiles -- the same refusal
//     /v1/repo/issues?stale=1 already makes.
