	// require publicly fetchable input, so no proxy sits in that data path —
	// yet the money is real and, measured on the deployment that prompted this,
	// larger than everything the gateway does see.
	//
	// Its CostUSD is THE INVOICE: taken as supplied and never recomputed from a
	// rate table (see pricing.Table.Cost). Consequences, all deliberate:
	//   - no per-app attribution. A daily invoice line has no consumer, and
	//     splitting it by call share would be an estimate wearing real money's
	//     clothes.
	//   - no token counters. The billing unit is seconds, images or calls.
	//   - the collector must only ingest a billing day once the vendor has
	//     settled it: dedup is by MessageUUID, so a later revision of the same
	//     day is ignored rather than corrected.

	// gateway could proxy it, but only by becoming a single point in a live
	// phone call, which is a far larger cost than the visibility is worth at the
	// volumes that prompted this.
	//
	// It is the counterpart of SourceVendorBill, and the two divide the work by

	//
	//   - This source carries USAGE and attribution. The app knows which tenant
	//     the call served, how many seconds it listened and how many characters
	//     it spoke. Measured on the deployment that prompted this, the invoice
	//     knows none of that: the vendor's own bill reported 0 seconds of speech
	//     recognition while the agent was demonstrably running.
	//   - The invoice carries the MONEY. Rows here stay unpriced unless a
	//     collector supplies a charge, and a billing item may be priced by
	//     exactly one side — whatever this source prices must be excluded from
	//     the bill collector's include list, or the same spend lands twice.
	//     Unpriced is the safe default precisely because double counting is the
	//     one error this ledger must never make.
	//
