// Growth facts: the business ledger that sits beside the token ledger.
//
// The rest of this package describes spend, and repo.go describes what the
// spend bought. This describes the third book: what the company actually earns
// while those two are running. Same hub, same SQLite file, same enrollment
// tokens — one internal ledger with three surfaces beats three dashboards
// nobody reconciles, and the issue number already joins the first two.
//
// The COLLECTOR is not in this repo, for the same reason the repo shipper is
// not: which production database, which credentials, how often and behind
// which firewall is a per-team concern. The hub is a sink.
//
// The half that matters most here is the half a machine CANNOT produce. The
// H5 subscription figures come off a production database every night; the AI
// deal figures are typed in by a person, and a person forgets. That asymmetry
// is why GrowthAI carries its own UpdatedAt and why AIStaleAfter exists: a
// dashboard printing last week's hand-filled number as though it were today's
// is worse than a dashboard printing nothing, because the reader cannot tell.

// GrowthDayLayout is the day key format: UTC calendar days, sortable as
// strings. Same shape as RepoDayLayout and deliberately its own name — the two
// ledgers key on the same kind of day and neither should have to read as the
// other to say so.
const GrowthDayLayout = RepoDayLayout

// AIStaleAfter is how long the hand-filled half may go without an update
// before a surface must stop printing its figures as current.
//
// Three days rather than a week: the AI deals are six conversations a person
// is personally carrying, and if nobody has touched them in three days the
// number on the board is not a fact about the business, it is a fact about who
// last opened the spreadsheet.
const AIStaleAfter = 3 * 24 * time.Hour

// GrowthSnapshot is one day of the business ledger as one shipper computed it.
//
// It is a whole-document snapshot keyed by (Source, Day), not a stream of
// deltas: everything here is a LEVEL — money on the books, accounts alive
// today — and levels do not add up. A replayed push overwrites the day rather
// than doubling it, which is what lets a shipper retry a flaky POST and what
// makes a missed night a gap rather than something to be back-filled. There is
// no watermark and nothing catches up; a day nobody shipped stays missing, and
// that is the honest record of a cron job that did not run.

// Validate rejects a snapshot the hub cannot store honestly.

// block was not in the body" is distinguishable from "this block was in the
// body and every figure in it is zero". A value struct cannot tell those apart
// after decoding, and getting them confused is the expensive direction --
// a shipper that has nothing to say about the hand-filled half would silently
// overwrite it with zeros, which reads as "somebody confirmed these are 0"
// rather than "nobody has said anything lately".
//
// Contract (C2, as amended by the T3 caliber spike): a block that is absent
