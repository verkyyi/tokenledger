// The three kinds of money in this hub.
//
// cost_usd is one column carrying two different claims, and a third kind of
// money never enters that column at all:
//
//   - CostNotional — Claude and Codex. "What this would have cost at API
//     rates." Nobody is billed it. Useful for ranking, misleading as an
//     invoice.
//   - CostBilled — the gateway (metered per call) and vendor bills (read off
//     the invoice). Either way the figure IS money that was charged.
//   - subscription spend — real money, billed monthly whether or not a token
//     is spent. It lives in subscription_plans, never in cost_usd; see
//     store.SubscriptionSpend.
//
// Real spend is subscription + billed. A notional figure must never enter that
// sum, and two figures of different kinds must never be added at all. This is
// the same discipline get_account_usage and get_live already apply to
// overlapping TOKEN counters, extended to the column that looks like money.
const (
	CostNotional = "notional"
	CostBilled   = "billed"

	// CostUnknown is a source this build has not classified. It is deliberately
	// neither kind: a new source defaulting into "notional" would silently add
	// a real charge to an estimate, and defaulting into "billed" would do the
	// reverse. Unknown money is reported on its own and folded into nothing.
	CostUnknown = "unknown"
)

// Sources is every collector source this build knows, in display order.
//
// This is the closed set the cost split is built from: a source added to the
// constants above and forgotten here is caught by the guard in cost_test.go,
// because an unclassified source silently becomes CostUnknown everywhere.
var Sources = []string{SourceClaude, SourceCodex, SourceGateway, SourceVendorBill, SourceVoice}

// CostIsSupplied reports whether a source's cost_usd ARRIVES with the event
// rather than being computed from a rate table.
//
// It is a different axis from CostKind, and both matter. CostKind says what the
// figure means (estimate vs charge); this says who produced it. A vendor bill
// and a voice charge are read off an invoice or handed over by the reporting
// collector — there is no rate table that could reproduce them, and nothing
// downstream may try. Claude, Codex and gateway figures are derived, so a
// corrected rate should change them.
//
// The distinction exists because repricing is a real operation (Store.Reprice):
// a rate added today should reach the events it applies to, INCLUDING the ones
// already stored. Run that over a supplied figure and it would overwrite an
// invoice with whatever a rate table happened to say — the one error a ledger
// of real money cannot make. So the reprice path asks here first and refuses to
// write when a supplied figure would move.
//
// Kept beside CostKind on purpose: one place decides, so adding a source is one
// edit and a failing test rather than a silently rewritten invoice.

// names inline: one place decides, so adding a source is one edit and a failing

		// though they are measured differently (metered per call vs. read off
		// the invoice). Real spend is one question — "what did this cost" —
		// and the two answers are commensurable; a notional figure is not.
		// ⚠️ They can still DOUBLE-COUNT if a collector ever bills the same
		// spend both ways. Keep the division at the source: the bill collector
		// must only carry what no gateway route can see.

// HasQuotaWindow reports whether a source's account can have a QUOTA WINDOW at
// all — a pool with a ceiling and a reset that "am I about to hit the wall?"
// is a question about.
//
// It is a third axis, independent of the two above: CostKind says what the
// money means and CostIsSupplied says who produced it, while this says whether
// there is a ceiling to be near. A gateway or voice "account" is one calling
// application and a vendor_bill "account" is an invoice; all three are billed
// per call, so they have no window, no percentage, and no reset. That is not
// the same as a subscription whose window nobody managed to READ — and the two
// must never render as one sentence, the way "free" and "no rate configured"
// were separated in 299bd67.
//
// The default is deliberately false: a source added to the constants and
// forgotten here goes missing from a quota card, which is visible and
// harmless, rather than appearing there forever saying "no reading available".
// web/dist/lib/providers.js mirrors this set for the dashboard's own filter;
// the guard in cost_quota_test.go keeps both honest.
