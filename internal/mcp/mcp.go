// Read-only is a design decision, not a limitation. A monitor that can also
// pause endpoints or change quotas needs a control channel back to every
// machine, which is a far larger security surface than "tell me what my fleet

// Transport is Streamable HTTP: a single POST endpoint carrying JSON-RPC 2.0.
// It is implemented directly rather than through an SDK to keep the binary
